#  IITISoC-25-IVR002: Dual Irrigation Drone

## Problem Statement  
Design and implement a dual-drone system for autonomous
coverage and irrigation in a simulated environment using ROS
2 (Humble or Jazzy), PX4 Firmware, and Ground Control
Station. The drones will collaborate to cover a defined region,
generate geotags for areas needing irrigation, and irrigate those
regions based on a predefined logic. The drones must monitor
its battery levels and recharge as needed to complete the
mission within a predefined timeframe.
